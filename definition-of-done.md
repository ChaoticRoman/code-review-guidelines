# Definition of Done

A "Definition of Done" (DoD) provides a shared understanding among the team about
what it means for work to be complete. This is pretty exhausting list and should
be tailored to your specific needs.

## Code:

* Code is written according to the team's coding standards.
* Code is reviewed and any identified issues are addressed. (See [code review guidelines](README.md))
* Code is checked into the version control system with a meaningful commit messages.
* Code is accompanied by appropriate comments and documentation.
* Dependencies (e.g., libraries, tools) are properly managed and documented.
* All warnings and errors generated by the compiler are addressed.
* Unused code, debug code, and commented-out code have been removed.

## Testing:

* Unit tests are written for all new functionality and changes.
* All unit tests pass successfully.
* Code coverage meets or exceeds the team's agreed-upon threshold.
- Integration tests are conducted and pass successfully.
* Performance tests, if applicable, meet required benchmarks.
* Regression tests have been run and any regressions addressed.
* Hardware-in-the-loop testing (if applicable) has been performed and passed.

## Documentation:

* Inline documentation is up to date.
* External documentation, like user manuals or system specs, is updated as needed.
* API documentation (if applicable) is generated and accurate.

## Security:

* Code has undergone security review.
* Known vulnerabilities are addressed.
* Security tests have been conducted and passed.

## Integration:

* Changes are integrated into the main branch and do not break the build.
* Integration with external systems/interfaces has been tested.
* Firmware can be successfully built and deployed to target hardware.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

* The product meets all agreed-upon non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, reliability, usability).

## Review:

* Product Owner (or designated stakeholder) has reviewed the functionality and accepted it.
* Feedback from demos, if any, has been addressed.

## Miscellaneous:

* All known defects and issues are documented in the backlog.
* Any necessary configurations or settings have been documented.
* All code and changes are traceable to associated requirements or user stories.
